Pure Python. Claude Code is the LLM.\n\nHARD ENFORCEMENT:\nWhen EriRPG is imported, file write hooks are automatically installed.\nAny attempt to write files without going through EriRPG will be BLOCKED.\nThis ensures all code changes follow the EriRPG workflow:\n    1. Create an Agent\n    2. Run preflight()\n    3. Use agent.edit_file() or agent.write_file()\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.0\"\n__author__ = \"Alex\"\n\n# Install hard enforcement hooks FIRST\nfrom erirpg.hooks import install_hooks\ninstall_hooks()\n\nfrom erirpg.graph import Graph, Module, Interface, Edge\nfrom erirpg.registry import Registry, Project\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"Graph\",\n    \"Module\",\n    \"Interface\",\n    \"Edge\",\n    \"Registry\",\n    \"Project\",\n]\n", "timestamp": "2026-01-26T18:43:14.135489"}
