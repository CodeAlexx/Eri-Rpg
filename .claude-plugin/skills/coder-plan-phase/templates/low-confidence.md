# Low Confidence Template

Use when RESEARCH.md has `confidence: LOW`.

**CRITICAL: Do NOT proceed to planning without user approval.**

```markdown
## ⚠ Research Confidence is LOW

The researcher flagged significant uncertainty:

### What's Uncertain

{Extract from RESEARCH.md "Open Questions" or low-confidence sections}

### Why It Matters

Planning with low confidence often produces inadequate plans that fail verification.
Better to clarify now than re-plan later.

## Options

1. **Dig deeper** — I'll spawn researcher with Level 3 depth for more thorough investigation
2. **Proceed anyway** — Continue to planning despite uncertainty (risk of gaps)
3. **Pause** — Stop here, you investigate manually or provide guidance

Which would you prefer?
```

**Wait for explicit user response before proceeding.**

**Replace:**
- Uncertainty details from RESEARCH.md
- Any specific questions the researcher flagged
